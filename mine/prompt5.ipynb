    "        The definition of each rhetorical role is given below:\n",
    "        Preamble: A typical judgement would start with the court name, the details of parties, lawyers and judges' names, Headnotes. This section typically would end with a keyword like (JUDGEMENT or ORDER etc.) Some supreme court cases also have HEADNOTES, ACTS section. They are also part of Preamble.\n",

    "        Argument by Respondent: Arguments by respondents lawyers. Precedent cases argued by respondent lawyers fall under this but when court discusses them later then they belong to either the relied / not relied upon category. E.g. “learned counsel for the respondent argued that …”\n",
    "        Analysis: Courts discussion on the evidence,facts presented,prior cases and statutes. These are views of the court. Discussions on how the law is applicable or not applicable to current case. Observations(non binding) from court. It is the parent tag for 3 tags: PRE_RLEIED, PRE_NOT_RELIED and STATUTE i.e. Every statement which belong to these 3 tags should also be marked as ANALYSIS. E.g. “Post Mortem Report establishes that .. “ E.g. “In view of the abovementioned findings, it is evident that the ingredients of Section 307 have been made out ….”\n",
